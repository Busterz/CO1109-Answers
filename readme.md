Currently, we are working on writing answers (with supported Java source code) for all the past year exam questions.

We plan to add all exercises' answers in the future. (Pull Requests with such contributions welcome)

We have verified source code available for all Java coding-related questions available in the relevant directory's page in the `java-src` directory.

## Viewing Answers
Browse the repository on GitHub and navigate to the appropriate directory.

All answers are written in Markdown format.

## Running Java Files

Unless placed in a sub-directory, these source files have not been `package`d, and can be executed directly after compiling by running `java <filename-without-extension>` on the command line.

For example, to run Question 3b part III, just execute:
```
java q3biii
```

Note that we do not include compiled .class files. You can either import the files into your favourite Java-compatible IDE or compile from the command line.

```
javac q3biii
```
> Ensure you have included the JDK directory in your `PATH`!
