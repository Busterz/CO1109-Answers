# CO1109-Answers
Welcome to the CO1109 Answers page

***

Currently, we are working on generating answers for all the past year exam questions.

In the future, all exercises' answers will be available here as well.

We have verified source code available for all Java coding-related questions available in the relevant directory's page.

## Viewing Answers
Browse the repository on GitHub and navigate to the appropriate directory.

All answers are written in Markdown format.

## Running Java Files

All files are not packaged so you can run them directly on the command-line
For example, to run Question 3b part III, just execute:
```
java q3biii
```

Note that we do not include compiled .class files. You can either import the files into your favourite Java-compatible IDE or compile from the command line.

```
javac q3biii
```
> Ensure you have included the JDK directory in your `PATH`!
